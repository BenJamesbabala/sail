S.A.I.L.(Semi Automated Image Labeling)

The goal of this system is to greatly reduce the amount manual labeling needed to build image classification models.

** Tasks **
* Finish the rotational network building
* Bootstrapping with limited manual training
* Use Flask to serve the image results
* Server process that can do the whole cycle by itself
* It chooses what would the most helpful to work on next
* It also chooses where to ask a human for help. So a human can intermittently help out.
* This is better than pure process with no human help because it can work with or without a human.
